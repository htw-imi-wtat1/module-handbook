# Sprint 01 & 02

## Stories implemented in Sprint 1 (Plain Node App in other repository)

Story_042 - As a student or lecturer, I see an overview of the whole study program with all modules including Title, Format and ECTS on the site.
Story_023 - As a student, I can quickly get an overview of the my progress within the study program.


## Step 1: Using Express

Create a new application using express, and migrate your existing views to the new express app. This may result in a new repository, but does not have to.
Chose one or more stories where you can make use of the two new technological topics you've learned in Unit 2: View Templates and Dynamic Content.ls

## Topic of the Week: View Templates and Dynamic Content


The second sprint - covering Unit 02 / Setting up an app with express.js
has the usage of html templates, layouts and partials at its core.
Migrate your pages and routes you created with plain node.js to express.
Pick out two more user stories such that one of them will use the same layout,
and another one possibly a different main layout of the page.


What can be shared, what needs to be different? Are different layouts or a combinations of partials the way to go?
Sketch the structure of the site for at least three stories clearly marking their
commonalities and differences.

### Layouts and Partials

Look at your whole backlog and choose a story or more that requires a different view from your first stories, and
implement it using layouts and partials.

- created layout.js and adapted views
- made a partial for navigation items, eliminating the need for stating the active path twice for marking active paths.

### Passing Parameters in Routes

| 014 | As a student, I can see the whole study plan in a tabular view.

I make use of passing parameters via the route to switch between the two view options. The controller switches to
a different view template depending on the parameter.
(I've also renamed the route from students to modules)


### Displaying Dynamic Content

Find a Story that can make use of Passing content from the controller to the view and displaying it with a view template.

For implementing this, I will touch story 023 again and fill it with complete courses information.

#### 023 - As a student, I can quickly get an overview of my progress within the study program.

- created content in homeController.js and added it to the [student's view](http://localhost:3002/students)
